For as long as I can remember, Iâ€™ve had a genuine fascination for science: to discover why things work the way they do. Having a deep interest in computer science, I've accumulated over 8 years of experience in the field of Information Technology. I currently study Machine Learning and strive to integrate this new advancement of technology more commonly in the workplace. I spend my free time approaching complex problems by exploring new and unusual concepts of design, programming, and music. Take a look around and enjoy my ever-growing portfolio of unique work.
