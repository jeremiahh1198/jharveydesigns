For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a genuine fascination for science: to discover why things work the way they do. Having a deep interest in computer science, I’ve accumulated over 7 years of experience in the field of Information Technology. I currently study Human-Computer Interaction and strive to transform boring, hard to use products into something more elegant, with the end-user in mind. I spend my free time approaching complex problems by exploring new and unusual concepts of design, programming, and music. Take a look around and enjoy my ever-growing portfolio of unique work.
